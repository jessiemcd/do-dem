This is a folder full of analysis notebooks that are useful/functional for Jessie's purposes but not intended to be public-facing examples for others. Some are just copies of example notebooks that are modified for use with specific observations. All were originally run in the do-dem directory directly (so may break if run here â€“ take them out for use).
